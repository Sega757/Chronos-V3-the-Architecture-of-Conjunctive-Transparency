## 2026-09-10 - [Gitleaks PR Scanning Needs Explicit Permissions]
**Vulnerability:** N/A (Tooling issue)
**Learning:** The Gitleaks GitHub Action workflow requires explicit `permissions` for `contents: read` and `pull-requests: read` to avoid 403 'Resource not accessible by integration' errors when scanning pull requests.
**Prevention:** Always explicitly define required permissions block in GitHub Actions workflows, especially those involving automated PR checks.
