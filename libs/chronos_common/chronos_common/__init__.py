"""Shared primitives for every SCCS / Chronos V3 service.

This package intentionally has no dependency on any single subsystem
(System 1, System 2, or System 0) -- it is the common substrate that lets
those services agree on how bytes are hashed, signed, and canonicalized so
that Conjunctive Transparency (see docs/architecture/02-conjunctive-transparency.md)
holds across process and network boundaries.
